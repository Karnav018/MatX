Product Requirements Document: AR-Based Tile Visualization Web Project
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for an Augmented Reality (AR) based web application designed to allow users to visualize different tile patterns and materials on their own surfaces (floors, walls, etc.) in real-time using their device's camera. The goal is to provide a highly interactive and immersive experience that simplifies the tile selection process for homeowners, designers, and contractors.
2. Goals
Enhance User Experience: Provide an intuitive and engaging way for users to visualize tiles, reducing uncertainty in purchasing decisions.
Increase Sales Conversion: Drive higher sales for tile manufacturers and retailers by offering a compelling visualization tool.
Reduce Returns: Minimize product returns due to dissatisfaction with the tile's appearance in the actual space.
Improve Brand Engagement: Position the tile provider as an innovative and customer-centric brand.
Accessibility: Ensure the application is accessible via standard web browsers on modern smartphones and tablets without requiring app downloads.
3. Target Audience
Homeowners: Individuals looking to renovate or build, seeking to visualize tiles in their homes.
Interior Designers: Professionals who want to quickly showcase different tile options to clients in a realistic setting.
Contractors/Builders: For quick client approvals and project planning.
Tile Retailers/Showrooms: To offer an interactive tool to customers in-store or online.
4. Key Features
4.1. AR Visualization Core
Real-time Surface Detection: Automatically detect flat surfaces (floors, walls) in the user's environment using the device camera.
Tile Overlay: Overlay selected 2D/3D tile textures onto detected surfaces in real-time.
Perspective Correction: Ensure tiles are rendered with correct perspective and scale relative to the real-world environment.
Lighting Simulation (Basic): Basic simulation of ambient lighting to make the overlaid tiles appear more natural.
Multiple Tile Application: Ability to apply different tiles to different detected surfaces within the same view.
4.2. Tile Catalog & Selection
Extensive Tile Library: A comprehensive catalog of tile types (ceramic, porcelain, natural stone), patterns, colors, and sizes.
Search & Filter: Robust search and filtering capabilities (by color, material, size, price range, brand, etc.).
Tile Details: Display detailed information for each tile, including material, dimensions, price per unit/sq ft/sq meter, and high-resolution images.
Favorites/Wishlist: Users can mark tiles as favorites for easy access.
4.3. Interaction & Customization
Tile Rotation: Ability to rotate the tile pattern (e.g., 0°, 45°, 90°) on the surface.
Scaling/Grout Size Adjustment: Option to adjust the perceived scale of the tiles and the width of the grout lines.
Undo/Redo: Functionality to undo or redo recent changes to tile application.
Multi-Surface Selection: Allow users to select and apply tiles to multiple distinct surfaces within a single AR session.
4.4. Measurement & Estimation
Basic Area Measurement: Allow users to define an area on the detected surface (e.g., by tapping corners) and get an estimated area.
Tile Quantity Estimation: Based on the estimated area and selected tile size, provide an approximate number of tiles required.
Cost Estimation: Calculate the estimated cost based on tile quantity and price.
4.5. Save & Share
Capture Screenshot/Video: Users can capture screenshots or short video clips of their AR visualization.
Share Options: Share captured content via social media, email, or direct download.
Project Saving (Optional, requires user account): Users can save their visualization projects for later review or sharing. This would require user authentication.
4.6. User Account (Optional, Phase 2)
Registration/Login: User authentication via email/password or social logins.
Saved Projects: Access to previously saved visualization projects.
Order History/Quotes: Integration with e-commerce or quote generation systems.
5. Technical Requirements
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS for styling), JavaScript.
JavaScript Framework: A modern JavaScript framework such as React (recommended), Vue.js, or Angular will be used for building a robust, component-based, and maintainable user interface.
AR Framework: WebXR API (for native AR capabilities in browsers) as the primary choice, with AR.js as a fallback or for broader compatibility on older devices/browsers if WebXR is not fully supported.
3D Models/Assets:
Tile textures should be high-resolution and optimized for web delivery (e.g., JPG, PNG, WebP).
Consider using 3D models for complex tile patterns or realistic grout lines if a more advanced rendering is required (e.g., GLTF/GLB format).
Backend (for Tile Catalog & User Data):
Node.js/Python/PHP/Ruby on Rails (or similar) for API development.
Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Firestore for storing tile data, user profiles, and saved projects.
Hosting: Cloud platform (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS, Azure) with CDN for fast asset delivery.
Performance:
Optimized asset loading and rendering to ensure smooth AR experience (target 30+ FPS).
Responsive design for various screen sizes (mobile, tablet).
Security: Implement standard web security practices (HTTPS, input validation, authentication best practices).
6. User Stories (Examples)
As a homeowner, I want to see how different tiles look on my living room floor in real-time so I can make an informed decision before buying.
As an interior designer, I want to quickly show multiple tile options to my client on their actual kitchen wall so they can visualize the final look.
As a user, I want to be able to rotate the tile pattern so I can see how it looks in different orientations.
As a user, I want to get an estimated quantity of tiles needed for a specific area so I can budget accurately.
As a user, I want to capture a screenshot of my visualization so I can share it with family or friends for feedback.
As a tile retailer, I want to easily update and manage the tile catalog so that new products are available for visualization.
7. Future Enhancements (Phase 2 & Beyond)
Advanced Lighting/Shadows: More realistic lighting and shadow casting for enhanced immersion.
Furniture Placement: Ability to place virtual furniture to see how tiles interact with existing decor.
Multi-User Collaboration: Allow multiple users to view and interact with the same AR visualization simultaneously.
Integration with E-commerce: Direct "add to cart" or "request quote" functionality from the AR view.
AI-Powered Recommendations: Suggest tile patterns based on room style or user preferences.
Offline Mode: Basic functionality available even without an internet connection (for cached tiles).
